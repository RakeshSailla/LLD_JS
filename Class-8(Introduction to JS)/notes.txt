Injesting JS - Specifying the JS file in the html file using script tag
Why JS is called a scripting language - Because it is executed line by line
Why it is better to keep the script tag after body? - Because we want to execute the script after all the elements are loaded in DOM
Previously JS runs only on the browser[restricted to browser]. to solve this problem, Node.JS was introduced to run it on local machines.
Node JS: run time environment.

Node --version to check what version of node is installed in the machine by using command prompt

Running JS in local machine without a browser:
C:\Users\Rakesh>node
Welcome to Node.js v22.14.0.
Type ".help" for more information.
> console.log("hello")
hello
undefined
> alert('Yes')
Uncaught ReferenceError: alert is not defined
> console.warn('it is a warning!')
it is a warning!
undefined
> var x = 10; console.log(x)
10
undefined
>
